# Learning Achieved through CAD Drawings

During my practice of above CAD drawings, I have acquired the following skills:

- Utilized basic drawing commands such as Line, Circle, Arc, Rectangle, and Polygon to create various shapes and geometries.
- Employed editing commands like Move, Copy, Rotate, Mirror, and Scale to modify and manipulate objects within drawings.
- Gained proficiency in layer management to organize and categorize different elements of my drawings effectively.
- Implemented dimensioning tools including Linear, Angular, and Radial dimensions to add precise measurements to my designs.
- Learned the process of creating and editing blocks to create reusable components within my drawings.
- Developed an understanding of coordinate systems to accurately position and align objects in my drawings.
- Introduced to basic 3D modeling techniques, allowing me to create three-dimensional representations of objects.
- Mastered the use of snap and grid settings to ensure precision and alignment in my drawings.
- Utilized hatch and gradient fills to add depth and detail to my designs.
- Leveraged text and annotation tools to add labels, notes, and other informative elements to my drawings.
- Utilized grips for editing to quickly and intuitively modify objects within my drawings.
- Explored plotting and printing configurations to prepare my drawings for presentation and documentation purposes.
